## 📂 Project Files

### Key Configuration Files

1. Dockerfile <br />
   Defines the application containerization process for building and running the Next.js project.

2. docker-compose.yml <br />
   Simplifies multi-container setup, ensuring smooth orchestration for local development and production environments.

3. deploy.yml <br />
   Automates the deployment workflow using GitHub Actions, facilitating continuous integration and deployment.

### 📜 Pipeline Workflow

1. Build Stage
   - Docker builds the Next.js application image using the **Dockerfile**.
   - Dependencies are installed, and the application is compiled.
2. Test Stage
   - Run automated tests to validate the application functionality.
3. Deployment Stage
   - The **deploy.yml** GitHub Actions workflow pushes the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub or AWS ECR).
   - Deploys the container to the desired environment (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean, or a Kubernetes cluster).

## 🛠️ How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
- Access to a container registry (Docker Hub, AWS ECR, etc.).
- A configured GitHub repository for CI/CD integration.

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/cashblaze127/CI-CD-NextJs.git
cd CI-CD-NextJs
```

2. Build and run the container locally:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

3. Push changes to the GitHub repository to trigger the CI/CD pipeline:

- GitHub Actions will handle the build, test, and deployment stages defined in the `deploy.yml` file.
